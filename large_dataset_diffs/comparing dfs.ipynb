I worked with them on replenishment and customized a template to fit their needs however they are not excel people...

Because of this, we can not show ROI and client is likely to churn at end of POC., nan, 02 Feb (TV):  updating to Critical as the client has decided to cancel.  Client felt that our product roadmap was not in alignment with their needs.  More specifically they are looking for a more comprehensive multi-channel solution to handle all their marketplaces which include a stand-alone repricer for ebay, walmart, jet, google and staples.   To mitigate we had a joint conversation between the client and Haniel to help better align client needs with our roadmap including requesting their involvement as a design partner for walmart and our API development.  Client was not interested nor was he open to further discussion.  Should also be noted that their sales have dropped from 1.5MM to just over 400K in the last 12 months., Increasing churn probability as the account was suspended on Amazon. Will work closely with the seller to try and get him reinstated., 11/10/2017: reestablished contact with the client and they are now repricing 73% of their products following the delay outlined below. Client has not expressed any concerns with our service. They expressed some interest in extending their trial period when the idea was floated, but they have not asked for it proactively yet.
